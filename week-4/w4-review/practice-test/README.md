# Practice Asssesment Instructions:

**Open the "index.html" file in your browser WITH LIVE SERVER (see note below)
so that you're able to work with cookies. The HTML page contains a list of
tests that you must make pass to complete this portion of the practice
assessment.**



**For example, the first test reads:**

PROBLEM 1: Make the circle blue

> - Button `id`: `make-circle-blue`
> - Div `id`: `blue--circle`

> When you click the button below, you should add the "blue" CSS class to the
> blue circle. Adding the "blue" CSS class will turn the inside of the circle blue. 

Open "your-code.js" and write the code to make that happen. If you have written
the correct code, then you can click the button and see the circle turn blue.

Make all of the tests pass by writing code in "your-code.js" and interacting
with the test in the way specified.
